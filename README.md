[00:15.79] I'm holding on your rope
[00:17.74] Got me ten feet off the ground
[00:24.01] And I'm hearing what you say
[00:25.89] But I just can't make a sound
[00:40.39] 
[00:31.96] You tell me that you need me
[00:34.43] Then you go and cut me down, but wait
[00:40.23] You tell me that you're sorry
[00:42.44] Didn't think I'd turn around and say
[01:00.44] 
[00:48.18] That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
[00:56.04] I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
[01:04.49] Too late, oh
[01:10.49] 
[01:12.85] I'd take another chance, take a fall
[01:15.65] Take a shot for you
[01:20.89] And I need you like a heart needs a beat
[01:23.80] But it's nothing new, yeah yeah
[01:39.30] 
[01:29.15] I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue
[01:34.54] And you say sorry like the angel
[01:39.51] Heaven let me think it was you
[01:43.13] But I'm afraid
[01:50.13] 
[01:45.56] It's too late to apologize, it's too late
[01:52.96] I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late, whoa
[02:19.96] 
[02:19.75] It's too late to apologize, it's too late
[02:27.41] I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
[02:35.76] I said it's too late to apologize, yeah, too late
[02:43.61] I said it's too late to apologize, yeah, too late
[03:08.11] 
[02:52.60] I'm holding on your rope
[02:54.47] Got me ten feet off the ground
